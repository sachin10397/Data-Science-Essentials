Problem :
Consider a building with 'n' number of steps. A dice is given to you.
You are allowed to throw the dice 100 times
if the number on dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down
if the number on dice is 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up
if you throw a 6, you throw the dice again, this time the number on dice determines the number of step you go up (1,2,3,4,5 or 6)
you cannot go lower than step number 0
there's a 0.1% chance of you falling while playing. If you fall, you will start from step number 0 again

What is the probability of you reaching step number 60?
